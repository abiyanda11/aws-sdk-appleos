All developers should feel welcome and encouraged to contribute to `aws-sdk-appleos`. Although as this repository is a child of [`aws-sdk-swift`](https://github.com/swift-aws/aws-sdk-swift) it is preferable you make any pull requests on that repository and not `aws-sdk-appleos`.

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

To contribute a feature or idea to `aws-sdk-swift` or `aws-sdk-appleos`, submit an issue and fill in the template. If the request is approved, you or one of the members of the community can start working on it.

If you find a bug, please submit an issue or pull request with a failing test case displaying the bug.
